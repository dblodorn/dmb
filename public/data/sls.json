{"project_name":"sls","project_copy":"This project was the invite for the grand opening of the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, it was the first SLS property and a lot of fun to launch, GBH London (not the band) did the overall branding in collaboration with Philippe Starck and We got to go to town with it in house - Rolling out at least 120 pieces of collateral. This was my favorite piece, I had a lot of fun concepting the Advent Calendar meets Russian Doll mechanical and working with a variety of printers on the production and assembly of this very elaborate print object - all in - it was a nice summation of the SLS brand!","categories":["conceptual art","graphic design","web development"],"images":[{"project_image":"dain-blodorn-kim-sls-01.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim SLS Invite 01"},{"project_image":"dain-blodorn-kim-sls-02.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim SLS Invite 02"},{"project_image":"dain-blodorn-kim-sls-03.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim SLS Invite 03"},{"project_image":"dain-blodorn-kim-sls-04.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim SLS Invite 04"}]}
