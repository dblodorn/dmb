{"project_name":"tifsigfrids.com","project_copy":"Tif Sigfrids is a contemporary art gallery in Los Angeles that shows conceptual art - and boasts a truly fine roster of artists from both Los Angeles and abroad. I developed and designed this website for the gallery - it is a completely custom WordPress theme constructed from the ground up. Some exciting additions to the build were the use of sass for styling and gulp for task management. I also enjoyed working with the client in crafting an intuitive back-end using Advanced Custom Fields that left a lot of the WordPress cruft on the cutting room floor!","categories":["conceptual art","graphic design","web development"],"links":[{"link_copy":"visit site","site_link":"http://tifsigfrids.com/"}]}
