{"project_name":"zero-one","project_copy":"In 2001 the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art mounted a truly groundbreaking exhibition, 010101: Art In Technological Times. It was among the first major museum exhibitions to showcase art that dealt exclusively with the effects of technology. From where we are now, itâ€™s fascinating to look back at. Zero One was the opening event for the exhibition. I was fortunate to collaborate with Peter Spreenberg, Samuel Lising, Chris Francis, and Cameron Campbell. On the invitation (digital and physical) and the projections. The concept was rooted in digital detrius, and malfunctioning computers, I especially had fun creating the online invite and engineering the sound for it, as well as the print invitation. (thank you to Peter Spreenberg for the event photography & projection stills!)","categories":["conceptual art","graphic design","web development"],"images":[{"project_image":"zero-one-site.gif","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One web invite"},{"project_image":"zeroone-flyer1.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"},{"project_image":"zeroone-flyer2.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"},{"project_image":"zeroone1.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"},{"project_image":"zeroone7.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"},{"project_image":"zeroone2.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"},{"project_image":"zeroone4.jpg","image_alt":"Dain Blodorn Kim Zero One"}]}
