  "dain": "<p>Iâ€™m a Designer / Artist / Web Developer that lives in LA with an overarching investment in communication systems; I traffic in the technologies and mediums that both facilitate, and inform them. My career spans several disciplines, but at its core is a passion for relaying information to others in an engaging, thought provoking and seductive manner. Be it an installation of non objective paintings, a user experience design, web application, print object, writing code or just writing - I enjoy the aesthetic process in tandem with the structural one beneath it. (AS AN ANALOGY) - I believe that the edge of a painting is just as interesting as the picture it holds off the wall, I approach every aspect of my work with with that ethos in mind.</p><p>I view each layer of every project I participate in as part of a larger whole. Each assignment presents a distinctive challenge in deciding what approach best suites it. I believe my experience across many fields gives me a unique perspective and an extensive skill-set to draw from.
