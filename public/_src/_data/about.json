  "dain": "<p>I have an overarching interest in communication systems and the technologies and mediums that facilitate and inform them. My career has spanned across several disciplines but at its core is a passion for relaying information to other people, be it via an installation of non objective paintings, designing and hand coding a bespoke website, creating a custom back-end, or exploring the code behind the digital interfaces we are increasingly becoming inseperable from.</p><p>I view every layer of each project I participate in as part of a larger whole. Each one of those projects present a distinctive challenge in deciding what medium best suites it. My experience across many fields gives me a unique perspective and a large skill-set that can be applied to a broad variety of assignments. I hold a deep passion for web development and am constantly exploring new technologies and how they can facilitate notable interactive experiences. <a href='mailto:hello@dain.kim'>Email Me</a> for Full CV & Additional Work Samples.</p>",
