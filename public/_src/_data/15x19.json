  "project_copy": "15x19.io is essentially the culmination of moving around through various wet studios over 3 years and making 119 15x19 Paintings. I don't quite consider this project done, as i'm fascinated by the notion of a chunk of paintings floating around trying to found their identity in so many different ways. The show was a blast because i put them all on the floor and people were encouraged to flip through them - buy one if they like and experience them as interactive objects and not your typical painting hung on a wall. They did, and oddly enough - enjoyed it. I've got plans to update the web component of the project - so stay tuned - but enjoy whats up now too!",
